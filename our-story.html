            At Charity:Water, we believe a world where everyone has clean and safe drinking water is possible. Our founder, Scott Harrison, started this organization in 2006 after seeing firsthand the global water crisis while working as a photojournalist on a hospital ship in West Africa. He came back to New York City determined to use his story-telling skills to inspire people to help.

From day one, we made two promises: 100% of every public donation goes directly to water projects, and we prove every project with photos and GPS coordinates. We cover operating costs through a separate group of private donors, so every penny you give can go straight to bringing clean water to communities in need.

We work with trusted local partners to build sustainable water solutions, train communities, and ensure long-term success. Over the years, with the help of millions of supporters worldwide, we’ve funded over 100,000 water projects across dozens of countries, serving over 17 million people—and counting.

Our story is about hope and action. Clean water changes everything: health improves, kids can go to school, and families can thrive. We’re on a mission to end the water crisis in our lifetime, and we won’t stop until every single person on earth has access to clean water.
